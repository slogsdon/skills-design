description: Generate a YouTube channel banner — pixel-exact 2560×1440 full canvas + 1546×423 safe-zone preview canvas in a single HTML file. The full banner bleeds to the edges (TV display uses it all); the safe zone (1546×423 centered) is the cross-device area where critical content MUST sit. Reads ./design/<brand-slug>/DESIGN.md, tokens.css, and components.html. Triggers include "youtube banner", "youtube channel art", "channel banner", "/youtube-channel-art".

# Skill: youtube-channel-art

Produces a single self-contained HTML file containing **two pixel-exact canvases**:

1. **Full banner** (2560×1440) — the TV-display-ready full asset that uploads to YouTube
2. **Safe zone preview** (1546×423) — what mobile + desktop visitors actually see; ALL critical content must sit inside this zone

YouTube renders the same banner asset at vastly different aspect ratios across devices (TV uses the full 2560×1440; desktop crops to a wide letterbox; mobile crops to a tighter rectangle). The safe zone is the only region guaranteed visible everywhere. Brand mark + tagline live in the safe zone; the wider canvas extends with breathing room (or texture, or extension of brand surface) that TV viewers see.

## When to use

- User runs a YouTube channel and needs banner art that works across TV / desktop / mobile
- A `DESIGN.md` exists for the brand

## Inputs

- **Required:** brand slug, channel name (or wordmark text)
- **Required:** tagline (1 line, max ~10 words; sentence-case ending in period per brand voice)
- **Optional:** category labels (e.g. "field notes · payments · platforms"), social handle for footer
- **Optional:** secondary cue (e.g. upload schedule "new every Tuesday.")

## Output

`./design/<brand-slug>/artifacts/youtube-channel-art-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`

## Steps

### 1. Verify brand exists

```bash
test -f ./design/<brand-slug>/tokens.css
```

### 2. Gather the brief

Ask in one message:

```
1. Channel name / wordmark
2. Tagline — 1 line, max 10 words, sentence-case ending in period
3. Optional category strip — short topic labels separated by mid-dot
4. Optional secondary cue — upload schedule or call-to-action
5. Social handle (optional, footer position)
```

If the user gives 11+ words for the tagline, push back: "It needs to fit in the 1546×423 safe zone with breathing room. What's the line that lands?" Don't proceed until they agree.

### 3. Pick variation — apply CONSISTENTLY to both canvases

The full banner and safe zone preview must show the same content treatment — they're the same asset rendered at different framings. Pick ONE:

- `chrome-led` — wordmark + tagline + small meta strip. Brand-earned for editorial channels (Shane's instinct).
- `inverse-text` — full canvas dark inversion (canonical v2 feature treatment). Wordmark in cream on ink.
- `type-only` — wordmark at max scale, tagline below; no chrome.
- `object-of-content` — banner looks like a fragment of the channel's actual content (e.g. a working-notes index excerpt; a transcript line)

The wider 2560×1440 canvas EXTENDS the safe zone composition with breathing room — typically empty cream space or a subtle column rule pattern. It does NOT add additional content beyond the safe zone. The reason: TV viewers see the empty bleed area; it should feel intentional (negative space), not like a missed opportunity.

### 4. Generate the HTML

  - REMOVE the .canvas-full::after dashed safe-zone outline before exporting (it's a design guide only)
  - YouTube auto-crops per device. Verify your safe-zone preview holds the brand identity.

### 5. Verify

- [ ] Full canvas is exactly 2560×1440
- [ ] Safe zone preview is exactly 1546×423
- [ ] All critical content (wordmark, tagline, meta) sits inside the safe zone region
- [ ] Wider canvas treatment is INTENTIONAL negative space — not duplicated content, not random decoration
- [ ] Safe-zone outline indicator (the dashed `::after`) is present in the file but commented out / `display:none` for final export
- [ ] Architecture archetype documented and applied consistently to both canvases
- [ ] **Read `../design-anti-patterns.md` and verify the artifact violates none of its rules.** Pay special attention to sections 1 (no decorative orbs / patterns / icons), 2 (no italics-emphasis OR single-word color emphasis as default), and 4 (architecture must reach inner blocks)
- [ ] Tagline is at most 10 words and ends in period

> YouTube channel art at `./design/<brand-slug>/artifacts/youtube-channel-art-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`.
>
> Archetype: `<picked>`. Export the 2560×1440 canvas as PNG (remove the safe-zone dashed outline before export). Upload via YouTube Studio → Customization → Branding → Banner image.

## Anti-Slop Rules

Governed by three shared canonical references — read them, do not restate them:

- **`../design-anti-patterns.md`** — the hard floor. Wins every conflict.
- **`../design-principles.md`** — the craft floor (typographic hierarchy, spatial rhythm, color theory, layout logic, visual tension).
- **`../design-variation-sop.md`** — the named-aesthetic roster + the procedure for varying every invocation.

**Forbidden (fast scan — the references hold the full list):**

- Indigo/violet/purple as default accent or primary — the `hsl(230–280)` family on a near-white surface. The single loudest AI tell.
- Purple→blue / "aurora" / gradient-mesh backgrounds; gradient-fill text.
- Glassmorphism without an explicit AA-contrast scrim; floating gradient "blobs" as atmosphere.
- The three-up icon-card feature grid; the "hero → 3 cards → CTA" median skeleton.
- One global border-radius on every element; timid evenly-weighted low-contrast palette.
- Inter / Roboto / Arial / Open Sans / Lato / Helvetica / system as the primary family (Space Grotesk = yellow flag). Use a category-matched stack from the variation roster.
- Value-free CTAs ("Get Started", "Learn More", "Sign Up"); the two-CTA hero. Name the real action and its value.

**Required variation (every invocation):**

- Make at least **two** intentional decisions that differ from the safe defaults (palette, layout structure, typographic voice, or spatial density) AND from the most recent artifact in this brand.
- Never default to "clean / minimal / modern" — that is the absence of a direction (variation-sop Rule 1).
- Sketch **three distinct directions**, offer them as a one-line menu, generate the best-fit by default, all three only if asked (variation-sop Rule 3).

**Authenticity:** prefer specific over generic everywhere — real datelines (not "today"), the brand's actual voice (not "build the future" filler), concrete CTAs over placeholders.

## Rules

- **Two canvases, one composition.** Both render the same brand treatment; they exist to verify cross-device legibility, not to show different designs.
- **Safe zone is non-negotiable.** Mobile + desktop visitors see ONLY the 1546×423 center. If your wordmark or tagline doesn't fit there, redo with smaller scale.
- **Wider bleed is intentional negative space.** Don't fill it with decoration to "use the space" — TV viewers should see committed cream surface or a subtle pattern, not panic-filled iconography.
- **Pixel exactness on both canvases.**
- **Token-pure.** Every visual value via `var(--*)` from tokens.css.
- **Anti-pattern compliance.** This skill defers to three shared canonical references: `../design-anti-patterns.md` (the hard floor — wins every conflict), `../design-principles.md` (the craft floor), and `../design-variation-sop.md` (direction roster + offer-3 procedure). The anti-patterns file is the canonical anti-tell list.
